# Crop Yield Prediction &amp; Variation Across the State Of Odisha

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting crop yield and analyzing its variation across different districts of Odisha. Using data analytics, we aim to provide insights that help farmers, policymakers, and agricultural stakeholders make informed decisions regarding crop production and resource allocation.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Jupyter Notebook (Python)** – Data analysis and modeling
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **Year** – The year of crop production
- **State Code** – Unique identifier for Odisha
- **State Name** – Name of the state
- **District Name** – District within Odisha
- **Crop** – Type of crop grown
- **Area (1000 ha)** – Land area used for cultivation
- **Production (1000 tons)** – Crop production in metric tons
- **Yield (Kg per ha)** – Crop yield per hectare

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Predict crop yield based on historical data
- Identify patterns and trends in crop production
- Compare yield variations across different districts
- Develop a Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Gather historical crop yield data
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, format data
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify trends, correlations
4. **Model Development** – Use machine learning models to predict yield


## 📈 Key Features
- Predictive analytics for crop yield forecasting
- Comparative analysis across districts
- Actionable insights for policymakers and farmers


## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Incorporate weather data for improved predictions
- Develop a web-based interface for easy accessibility
- Integrate real-time data for continuous monitoring
- Interactive Power BI dashboards
